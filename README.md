# TextDetection-using-CNN-from-scratch


The code detects text by creating a **Convolution Neural Network** to Classify digits from 0 to 9. The Training code is **written from scratch** and it trains about 10000 images of 10 different classes . Testing script can deduce the trained model data to use along with a **webcam to detect Digits from 0 to 9**.

The training code is available under tha name "CNN_Training"
and the testing code is available under the name "CNN_Testing"

Once the training process is over the code generates the accuracy and validation perentage, a graph which shows accuracy vs epoch, and validation vs epoch is also attached along in "Figure 1 and 2" respectively

The trained model for 10 epochs is also available under "model_trained_10.p"

The Dataset which is used for training the CNN is obtained from Char74K  http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/ and the same is also available in the attached drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1slSnyeaGT6Y1wkjnk52J3gUJTaDNR96t?usp=sharing
